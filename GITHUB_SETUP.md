# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

The local Git repository has been initialized and the initial commit has been made. To complete the GitHub setup:

## Steps to Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name the repository: `scout-events-website`
4. Set it to Public (required for Netlify free tier)
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands from the `scout-events-website` directory:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/scout-events-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Verify Setup

After pushing, you should see all the project files in your GitHub repository, including:
- config.yaml (Hugo configuration)
- content/ directory with initial pages
- archetypes/ directory with event template
- README.md with project documentation

The repository is now ready for Netlify deployment setup in the next task.
